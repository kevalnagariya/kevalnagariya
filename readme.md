### 🧠 About Me
Hi, I’m a passionate **WordPress & Front-End Developer** with a knack for creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly web experiences.  
I enjoy solving problems, learning new tools, and making projects both functional and visually engaging.

Outside of coding, you’ll often find me **gaming 🎮**, **exploring good food 🍕🍣**, or **collaborating with friends and teammates 🤝**.  
I believe in keeping things **simple, effective, and fun** along the way.

Always curious and eager to grow, I’m excited to contribute to impactful projects, learn new technologies, and keep improving my craft 🚀.
